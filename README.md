ðŸ‘‹ **Greetings, Fellow Coders!**  
I'm Siddharth Donga, your friendly neighborhood **Full Stack Developer** and **DevOps Maestro** on a mission to turn coffee into code and deploy dreams into reality. With a keyboard as my wand and a terminal as my spellbook, I weave enchanting experiences in the digital realm.

ðŸ’» **The Tech Odyssey**  
On my tech journey through the cosmos, I navigate the **backend galaxy** using the **Node.js mothership** and ride the stellar waves of **React.js in the frontend nebula.** As a **DevOps sorcerer,** I conjure clouds, containers, and continuous integration spells to ensure a smooth voyage.

ðŸš€ **Captain of the Digital Ship**  
As the captain of my digital ship, I steer through the **sea of APIs**, refactor the clouds, and hoist the sails of **scalable architecture.** Whether it's **debugging asteroids** or **conquering deployment dragons,** I thrive on the thrill of coding adventures.

ðŸŒŒ **Code Constellations**   
- **Backend Constellation**: Node.js, Express JS, Mongodb, PostgreSQL, PL/SQL, Nest Js  
- **Frontend Constellation**: React.js, HTML, CSS, Next JS, Bootstrap, MUI, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **DevOps Constellation**: Docker, Azure, AWS, GCP  
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Akahu, Salesforce, Xero, Basiq, Plaid, MailChimp, Calendly, WhatsApp API, Brevo, Stripe, or many others...  

ðŸ¤– **Automating Dreams**  
In the magical land of DevOps, I'm not just a coder; I'm a **dream automator.** I sprinkle **CI/CD pixie dust**, orchestrate deployments with elegance, and ensure that every commit is a step closer to a **digital utopia.**

ðŸš€ **Join the Adventure!**  
Embark on this **intergalactic coding adventure** with me! Let's explore uncharted territories, refactor the cosmos, and build a constellation of extraordinary projects together.  

**May your code compile and your deployments be swift!** ðŸŒŒâœ¨
